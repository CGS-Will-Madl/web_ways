			<p>In HTML there are a few tags that are essential to know. With all these you are required to add "&lt;tagName&gt;". To close any tag add a "&lt;/tagName&gt;".</p>
			
			<p>The most essential tag is the "html" tag, which you use to open all html files. You put the opening one at the start and the closing one at the end.</p>
			
			<p>"head" is also an important tag as you put your title of your webpage and metadata (a set of data that describes and gives information about other data.) in it. </p>
			
			<p>"body" is where you put headers, text, images, videos etc.</p>
			
			<p>"h" is short for header, it is basically a title, subheader, whatever you wish to call it. You put h and then a number between 1 and 6. The number represents the type of header, is the largest and boldest, 6 is the smallest and weakest. </p>
			
			<h1>1</h1>
			<h2>2</h2>
			<h3>3</h3>
			<h4>4</h4>
			<h5>5</h5>
			<h6>6</h6>
			
			<br/>
			
			<p>"p", short for paragraph, is used for ordinary text. It is what we use for what we are typing right now! It is probably the most common tag</p>
			
			<p>"br/" is for putting a break in anything, you can use it to put a break between anything, or start a new <br/> line like I just did</p>
